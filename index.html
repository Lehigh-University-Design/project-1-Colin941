<h2> What Is Net Neutrality</h2>

<p>The intention of Net Neutrality is to create open and free use of the internet for all uses. The term “Net Neutrality” was first coined by law professor Tim Wu in 2003. The goal is to create streamlined and fair data usage, blocking Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from increasing prices for customers. This is specifically important for rural areas or anywhere else that may need more data in order for the internet to be used properly. This also applies to VPNs and other applications that may change internet use, which ISPs had been trying to block in the early 2000s.

<h3> Rising Tensions </h3>

<p> The issue of fair usage began as early as the 1990s, when service companies began employing hostile pricing toward individuals, companies, and groups that had increased data usage. The debate of neutrality centered around the internet was classified as a Title I  or Title II service. A Title I service describes information services, while the former is telecommunications. The replacement of the Communications Act of 1934 by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 meant that the internet was under scrutiny for reclassification. The classification as a Title II meant that rather than being a service, the internet was a crucial part of  the standard communications and was necessary to be open and free.

<h5> Enacting the Law </h5>

<p> In 2005, the internet was officially classified as a Title II and would be followed up that same year with the FCC claiming Net Neutrality was necessary to ensure non discriminatory actions could be taken against data usage. After almost two decades it was decided that the practice of price changes to supply internet usage was illegal, allowing all users to have equal rights to use the internet. 
</p>



<h6> Downfall of Net Neutrality</h6>


<p>On December 14, 2017, the Net Neutrality Act would be repealed in a 3-2 vote by the FCC in order “to enact the Restoring [of’ Internet Freedom” (Net Neutrality in the United States - Wikipedia). This was immediately followed by Washington Attorney General Bob Furgeson threatening to sue over “illegal rollback of Net Neutrality.” A separate law created in California to introduce their own Net Neutrality law was met with lawsuits by different ISPs. A vote in favor of Net Neutrality restoration on October 19, 2023 was decided with another 3-2 vote. Plans are now in place for Net Neutrality to be instituted federally.
